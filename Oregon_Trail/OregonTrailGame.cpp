/*
 Drives the overall functionality of the game
 The main function will be very similar to the driver function in the library database program
 1. While total miles != miles required to win and the deadline hasn't been reached and a lose condition hasn't been fulfilled, stays in a loop and simply keeps executing turns
 2. Asks player what they want to do (rest, continue, hunt, etc) calls appropriate function
 3. if player chooses to quit, appropriate message printed, game loop exited
 4. checks mileage, calls milestone function if milestone is reached
 5. if not at a milestone, calcs whether a misfortune occurs, calls function as needed
 6. if not at a milestone, calc whether raid occurs, calls raid function as needed
 7. if total miles == number required to win, prints win message
 8. if game lost, prints loss message
 9. writes final stats to results.txt
